# Todo APP with Redux, Thunk, Reselect, Styled-Components, and Testing the Ecosystem

## React Ecosystem

- Redux : state management using Flux architecture
- Thunk : side effect management for permanent changes (network requests, modifying user data on a server or uploading an article etc)
- Reselect - Selector library for Redux - abstract away the state's structure
Redux takes care of managing and modifying the state of the application for us, the purpose of selectors is to *abstract away the details of how our data is stored in this state*
- Styled Components - management of appearance
